### About Jason



My name is Jason Giblin. I am a junior from Chicago, Illinois studying Math and Economics. A question that I would like to know the answer to by analyzing data is if physically active students have more academic success in college as opposed to non-physically active students. After graduation, I would like to take an extended trip traveling around North America to climb in different locations. Further down the line, I would like to have a full time job working as an actuary for a health insurance company. Ideally I would like to have a job in Denver or Salt Lake City. My career accomplishment goals are modest, I would simply like to have a steady job with a good work-life balance that will allow me to climb and do other outdoor activities as much as possible. I hope to learn in this course how to program in R, and to get a base for computer programming. I hope to learn enough that I will be successful in my summer actuarial internship for the healthcare company Cigna. An interesting fact about me is that I love to rock climb, I often go on climbing trips on weekends to different climbing areas.

### About YenTing

My name is Yen-Ting Shen. I am a junior from Taipei, Taiwan majoring in business information management. A question I would like to know is what's the best place to eat in Boulder? I would like to be a backpacker after my graduation and I wish I could work in a major company such as Google or Facebook as a data analyst. I hope the greatest career accomplishment will be a entrepreneur and successfully survive in this compativive world. I hope I can learn how to use R to analysis the data and be able to explain it to others. I want to buy the fried chicken restaurant Raising Cane's so I could go there to eat the fried chicken anytime I want!

### About Tiger

My name is Tiger Su and I am from Nanjing, China. 5 years ago, I came to the US to study. I finished high school in Tennessee and came to CU boulder continue my journey in the US. I'd like to know why In a Blackjack game dealer always has a greater chance of winning. After 6 months of graduation, I wish I can find a job I like to do, and rent a place live by myself. 5 years after graduation, I wish I have a stable job that I like, start saving money for purchase a house. I don't really have a specific career accomplishment, but I wish I can be the "Hero of Justice"(正義の味方). From this course, I hope I can learn some basics of data analyzes.

## About Emery

My name is Emery Schattinger and I am from Lakewood, Colorado. An interesting fact about my is that I am a triplet with two brothers the exact same age. One question that I would like to know the answer to would be if people who live at sea level live longer than people that live at 10,000 ft above sea level. One thing that I would love to have six months after graduation would be to have a real job and to start my career. Five years after I graduate I would love to be able to by my own house and have a good job. I hope my greatest accomplishment in my career are just to be able to keep a job that I enjoy and for me to be happy with my life.

### Feedback for Jason
YenTing- I think you 

Jason did very well on asking questions when he don’t know something. He went to the office hour get help. I know it is very hard to start learning something new, sometimes googling online might be a better solution then asking others.  -Tiger

Hi Tiger. I found your question about Blackjack very intriguing, and that would be an interesting problem to analyze with data. I would be interested to learn more about the "Hero of Justice" concept that you mentioned. -Jason Giblin

I really liked your question about why In a Blackjack game the dealer always has a greater chance of winning becasue it made me stop and think. Also what you want to do 6 months after graduaion becasue you want to do the same thing as me. - Emery

### Feedback for Emery
During the team meeting, Emery always came on time and studying by himself there even before the meeting. Self-study is definitely a good habit, asking others is also a very good way to study.  -Tiger

Hi Tim. I thought your bio was an interesting read. A piece of advice that I would give you is to maybe pick a different question that could be answered by data rather than what is the best place to eat in Boulder, which is a more subjective question. However, some of my personal favorites are Pasta Jay's, Golden Sun, and Cosmos Pizza. Additionally, there was a couple of spelling mistakes that you could fix, you mispelled competitive and you used analysis where you should have used the word analyze. -Jason Giblin
I really liked how you said that you wanted to work for google after you graduate becasue it shows that you are ambitious and want to be successful.  -Emery
Tim is very energetic all the time. He always get involved in the discussion. Sometimes, listening others opinion might be a better way when you stuck.  -Tiger

### Feedback for Emery
Hi Emery. I thought it is very cool that you are a triplet. One thing that I have a question about is what kind of job you want to get after graduation. You mentioned that you want to have a real job and start your career, and I am wondering what type of career you want to have. -Jason Giblin
Hi Baiyu. One thing that I found interesting about your bio was how you wanted to be an entrepreneur and run your own business after working for a big IT company. A question I have is if you do end up getting a Master's Degree, what field would you like that degree to be in? - Jason Giblin
Baiyu is quiet all the time, he also likes working by himself. However, Baiyu has a lot of experience on programing that he gives up useful suggestions during the team meeting.   -Tiger

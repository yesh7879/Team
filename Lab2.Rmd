### About Jason



My name is Jason Giblin. I am a junior from Chicago, Illinois studying Math and Economics. A question that I would like to know the answer to by analyzing data is if physically active students have more academic success in college as opposed to non-physically active students. After graduation, I would like to take an extended trip traveling around North America to climb in different locations. Further down the line, I would like to have a full time job working as an actuary for a health insurance company. Ideally I would like to have a job in Denver or Salt Lake City. My career accomplishment goals are modest, I would simply like to have a steady job with a good work-life balance that will allow me to climb and do other outdoor activities as much as possible. I hope to learn in this course how to program in R, and to get a base for computer programming. I hope to learn enough that I will be successful in my summer actuarial internship for the healthcare company Cigna. An interesting fact about me is that I love to rock climb, I often go on climbing trips on weekends to different climbing areas.
